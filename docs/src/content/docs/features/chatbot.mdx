## Overview

Whatomate's chatbot automation allows you to create intelligent, automated responses for your WhatsApp messages. From simple keyword-based replies to complex AI-powered conversations, you have full control over how your business responds to customers.

## Navigation

The Chatbot section in the sidebar provides access to all chatbot features:

- **Overview** - Dashboard with statistics and quick access to settings
- **Settings** - Configure chatbot behavior, business hours, and AI
- **Keywords** - Create keyword-based auto-responses
- **Flows** - Design multi-step conversation flows
- **AI Contexts** - Configure AI knowledge bases

## Chatbot Settings

Configure global chatbot behavior including greeting messages, fallback messages, and session settings.

### Greeting Message
The greeting message is automatically sent to new contacts when they first message your business (or after the session timeout expires). You can optionally add interactive buttons (up to 10) to guide users to common actions.

### Fallback Message
When no keyword rules, AI contexts, or conversation flows match an incoming message, the fallback message is sent. Like the greeting message, you can add interactive buttons to help users navigate.

### Interactive Buttons
Both greeting and fallback messages support WhatsApp interactive buttons:
- **1-3 buttons**: Displayed as quick reply buttons
- **4-10 buttons**: Displayed as a list menu

### Session Timeout
Configure how long a session remains active. When a user messages again after the timeout, they receive the greeting message as if starting a new conversation.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use buttons to guide users to common topics like "Track Order", "Speak to Agent", or "View Products".

## Business Hours

Configure when your chatbot is active and how it behaves outside business hours.

### Setting Up Business Hours

<Steps>

1. **Enable Business Hours**

   Toggle the business hours feature on in the Business Hours tab.

2. **Configure Daily Schedule**

   For each day of the week:
   - Enable or disable the day
   - Set opening and closing times

3. **Out of Hours Message**

   Configure a message to send when customers contact you outside business hours.

4. **Automated Responses Outside Hours**

   Choose whether to allow flows, keywords, and AI responses to work 24/7 (enabled by default) or restrict them to business hours only.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Even with business hours enabled, you can allow automated flows and keyword responses to work around the clock. This is useful for handling common inquiries while still informing customers of your operating hours.
</Aside>

## Keyword Rules

Create automated responses triggered by specific keywords or phrases.

### Creating a Keyword Rule

![Keyword Rule Editor](/whatomate/images/04-keyword-rule-editor.png)

<Steps>

1. **Define Keywords**

   Add one or more keywords or phrases that will trigger the rule.

2. **Set Match Type**

   Choose how keywords should be matched:
   - **Exact** - Message must match exactly
   - **Contains** - Message contains the keyword
   - **Starts with** - Message begins with the keyword
   - **Regex** - Use regular expressions for complex patterns

3. **Configure Response**

   Set the response type and content:
   - Text message
   - Template message
   - Media (image, video, document)
   - Trigger a conversation flow

4. **Set Priority**

   Assign priority to determine which rule applies when multiple rules match.

</Steps>

## AI Settings

Configure AI-powered responses to handle queries that don't match keywords or flows.

### Enabling AI Responses

<Steps>

1. **Choose an AI Provider**

   Select from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI.

2. **Select a Model**

   Choose the model that best fits your needs and budget.

3. **Configure API Key**

   Enter your API key from the provider (stored securely and encrypted).

4. **Set System Prompt**

   Define how the AI should behave and what context it should use for responses.

</Steps>
